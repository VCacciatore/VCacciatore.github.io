        <h2>A Contested Book</h2>
        <p>Very few books hold as crazy as a history The Catcher in the Rye does.
            John Lennon's murderer, Mark David Chapman, infamously revered the 
            novel's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. After shooting Lennon, Chapman
            remained at the scene reading the novel. Even in court, Chapman claimed
            his motivation for killing Lennon was to promote reading The Catcher in
            the Rye. 
         </p>
        <p>
            Adding on to the book's infamy, Regan's attempted assassin, John Hinckley
            Jr., admired Chapman and kept a copy of the book in his hotel room.
            With two murderers identifying with Holden Caulfield, The Catcher in the
            Rye has been a popular target for censorship and book bannings.
            Even without mentioning the murders, many overly-concerned parents have raised issue
            with the novel's crude language, flippant discussion of teen sexuality, and 
            misanthropic and self-destructive protagonist Holden Caulfield.
        </p>
        <p>
            However it is Holden's crude language, unfiltered honesty, and 
            outward hostility that makes The Catcher in the Rye a masterpiece.
            Despite the novel being published in 1951, Holden still sounds and acts
            like any modern adolescent. Beneath the layer of calling everyone
            "phonies", random conversations, and seemingly meaningless anecdotes, lies
            universal anxieties that allow all readers to symapthize with Holden.
